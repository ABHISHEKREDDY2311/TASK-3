# TASK-3
TASK 3 
For this task i used this google colab platform as it is always a reliable,easy to use platform and i utilized google adn gpt 4 for completion of task
STEP 1 : i imported all the required libraries (pandas, matplotlib,sklearn etc ) for the task
STEP 2 : next i uploaded, loaded and preprocessed the data 
STEP 3 : next i splited the data  using train_test_split model valuation method for training and testing the model 
STEP 4 : now i trained the linear regression model with the data
STEP 5 : in this step predicted using the  model
STEP 6: evaluated the model prediction using mean absloute and mean squared error for caluculating the model's average mistakes and  huge mistakes 
STEP 7: plotted the predictions of the model by ACTUAL PRICES VS PREDICTED PRICES 

*NOTE*=  for the whole process i got many errors such as 1.indentation 2.while loading the dataset 3.while aplitting the data 
         and i solved them using "gemini AI" which is an inbuilt option provided in google colab and for getting an idea to move to next step i used gogle and gpt very widely.
